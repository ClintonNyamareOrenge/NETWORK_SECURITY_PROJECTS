## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 🔎 Packet Sniffing & Analysis
- Tool: **Wireshark / tcpdump**
- Captures and analyzes network packets.
- Identifies suspicious traffic (e.g., port scans, unusual protocols).
- **Skills:** Network monitoring, protocol analysis.

### 2. 🛡️ Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Tool: **Snort**
- Configured IDS to detect port scans and brute-force attacks.
- Custom rules for monitoring SSH, HTTP, and DNS traffic.
- **Skills:** Signature-based detection, alert configuration.

### 3. 🚧 Firewall Configuration
- Tool: **pfSense**
- Implemented inbound and outbound filtering rules.
- Blocked malicious IPs and restricted unnecessary services.
- **Skills:** Network segmentation, access control lists.

### 4. 🔑 Secure Remote Access (VPN)
- Tool: **OpenVPN / WireGuard**
- Configured VPN for encrypted remote access.
- Tested confidentiality and integrity of traffic over public networks.
- **Skills:** Tunneling, encryption, authentication.

### 5. 🕵️ Log Monitoring & SIEM
- Tool: **ELK Stack WAZUH**
- Collected and analyzed network logs.
- Created dashboards for failed logins, unusual connections, DoS attempts.
- **Skills:** Threat detection, incident response.

### 6. 🧪 Penetration Testing (Network Vulnerability Scans)
- Tool: **Nmap / Nessus**
- Scanned a test network for open ports and vulnerabilities.
- Mapped services and identified outdated versions.
- **Skills:** Reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment.
